How to play:
1. Use the mouse to left-click on the squares.
2. The number of the square represents how many bombs it has in its vicinity (3x3).
3. You can use the right-click to flag/unflag a square (to mark where bombs can be).
4. Clear the entire board to win.
5. If you click on a bomb, you lose (the flags with different background color means it is not a bomb there)
